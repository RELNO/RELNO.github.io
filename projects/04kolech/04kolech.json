  "subtitle": "A Synagogue as a Space of Equality",
  "text": "In traditional Jewish synagogues, a physical barrier called a “septum” historically separated spaces for men and women, reflecting theological beliefs held over centuries. This competition aimed to explore a different approach—one that promotes greater equality while respecting religious principles. The project introduced a novel perspective on the septum: instead of being a mere divider, it transformed into a functional space that fosters unity. The reimagined septum became a versatile element, fulfilling various functions like circulation, lighting, and books storage within the synagogue. As a result, it took on a more communal role during synagogue rituals while also highlighting its significance as a symbol of unity.",
