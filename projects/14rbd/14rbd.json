  "text": "The New Meadowlands project aims to transform the Meadowlands basin by addressing a wide spectrum of risks and providing civic amenities while creating opportunities for redevelopment. The project focuses on the principles of protect, connect, and grow. A key component of the project is the creation of a large natural reserve called the Meadowpark, which not only offers flood protection but also connects and expands marshland restoration efforts by the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission. The Meadowpark serves as a recreational area accessible to the public and adds value to surrounding developments through its views and amenities. The Meadowband, consisting of a street, Bus Rapid Transit line, public spaces, recreation zones, and access points, defines the edge of the Meadowpark and brings together different systems and scales. The project aims to shift from suburban-style development to more urban typologies for a more intensive use of land.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the [New Meadowlands page](http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/our-work/all-proposals/winning-projects/nj-meadowlands) on the Rebuild by Design website.",
