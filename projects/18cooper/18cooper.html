            The Road Ahead encourages visitors to creatively consider how droids, bots, drones, and more can make streetscapes safer, transportation more equitable, and cities more sustainable.
            CityScope Cooper-Hewitt is a playful installation that depicts two extreme future scenarios of urban mobility: an all privately owned mobility world and a fully-shared, transit oriented future. Users are not only observing these two futures, but can also take active part in the design of densities and land-uses of each thus gaining insights on the broad aspects of each mobility future.
