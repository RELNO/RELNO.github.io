  "text": "CityScopeAR is an augmented reality urban simulation project that aims to reduce complexity in design and planning tools while providing support for data-driven environments for planners, designers, and decision-makers. The project utilizes modern simulation tools and cutting-edge AR applications to offer an immersive user experience in planning processes.\n\nCityScopeAR is built upon the cityI/O platform, which utilizes a scalable server-side architecture to enable remote and decentralized public participation. With self-explanatory web and mobile apps featuring high-end visualization and user interfaces, cityI/O facilitates better communication of complex planning processes and real-time aggregation of public opinions. The platform supports collaboration, participation, and decision-making in design and planning initiatives.\n\nFor more information, you can access the CityScopeAR GitHub repository, the cityI/O overview, and the PDF document related to the project.",
