  "text": "The City museum of Tel Aviv, locally called Beit Ha’ir, was opened to the public in December 2009 in honor of the city’s centennial. The building housed the city hall between the years 1926-1965 and then the city museum until 2001. The aim of the project was to restore the historical building that was the first civic center of the city. Together with Bialik Square, the building functioned as an urban focal point for ceremonies, celebrations, demonstrations and parades. The front facade occasionally served as a balcony for performances and historical events. The aim was not only to restore the historical appearance of the building but mainly to endow it with another performative cycle and re-structure it as a relevant civic center.\n Architects: Efrat-Kowalsky Architects\n Location: Bialik Square, Tel Aviv \nYear: 2006 - 2009\n Team: Yonathan Cohen, Ariel Noyman, Carmit Hernik-Saar",
