  "text": "DeepScope is a novel platform for interactive, real-time, and setup-less urban design visualization. It aims to replace traditional urban design practices with a machine-learned, generative visualization approach. The project utilizes a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and CityScope, a tangible user interface, to enable real-time prototyping and visualizations of urban design processes.",
