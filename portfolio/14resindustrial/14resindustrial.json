  "text": "The Resindustrial project examines the forces that instigate change in the South-Boston district, focusing on the growth and densification of the region. The studio explores the underlying logics and formal structures by comparing various patches of urban fabric, both local and global, historical and proposed. Through this exploration, the project aims to transform the urban territory by crystallizing, sharpening, and testing transformations against measures of indeterminacy and contingency. The goal is to develop design methods that are responsive to the dynamic composition of the area.\n\nFor more details, you can expand the collapsed section below.",
