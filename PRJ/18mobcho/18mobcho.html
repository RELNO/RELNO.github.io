<h5>A Mobility Choice API for CityScope Platform</h5>
<br />
<p>
  What is MoCho? The individual choices people make about their mobility
  behavior have profound impacts on their own lives as well as society as a
  whole. This is particularly true with regard to their chosen mode of urban
  transportation.  <br>

  <div id="demo" class="collapse">Motorized transportation leads to negative external impacts
        such as carbon emissions and air pollution, whereas active modes such as
        walking and cycling improve the physical and mental health of the travelers.
        Urban planning can influence these mobility choices and their societal impacts
        by organizing land uses in space in such a way as to encourage short trips
        using active modes. The MIT CityScope MobCho module uses tangible user
  interface that allows planners, engineers, and community members alike to
  experiment with urban interventions and see the predicted impacts on
  individual mode choice behavior as well as the resulting societal impacts. The
  behavioral models have been calibrated using a combination of individual and
  aggregate level census data for the greater Boston area.</div>
